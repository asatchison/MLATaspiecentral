Though not necessarily diagnosed I have a degree in social work and I honestly believe I am on the spectrum which has gave me so much relief. Anyways eye contact is horrible for me I hate it so much like when I am on the train all the time in my hometown NewYork I will try to do anything to not look people in the eye..it makes my heart start racing and I feel as thiugh they can tell I am getting frightened.s I wanted to know do people feel about the same and what makes you feel so uncomfortable with the eye thing??   Like x 1 Jun 4, 2014 #2 Ereth Well-Known Member Messages: 2,377 Karma: +2,001 Welcome to AspiesCentral! I think my fears about eye contact existed because people used to stare at me a lot when I was a child. (I have cerebral palsy, so my walk is different from the \"standard.\") But I've learned to handle eye contact better over time.   Like x 1 Jun 5, 2014 #3 Sass Moderator Staff Member V.I.P Member Messages: 1,241 Karma: +1,718 Hi Josolito I can look at people for a little while when they're talking to me, but often I end up looking just behind them, or to the side. I think I feel like I'm being scrutinised and looked at critically when people look me in the eye when I speak, which is actually what I'm doing when I look at things, and I just assume others do the same. I've worked out that if I put a look on my face like I'm considering what they're saying (which I usually am), then people don't tend to worry about it. Also, if you're on public transport and the proximity of people gets to you, then of course you don't want to make eye contact! Try taking a book and reading, that way no-one is likely to disturb you and you can look at pages instead   Like x 1 Jun 5, 2014 #4 Eliora Member Messages: 4 Karma: +2 Something I'm wondering is the following: when I talk I rarely make eye contact, it feels really uncomfortable. But when the other person is talking I do make eye contact all the time, which feels normal. Am I in a group, then I make eye contact with no one except the person talking (in case of a presentation). Does anyone have something similar?

Yes I will only do it if the person is speaking with me though it can feel uncomfortable at times I try to maintain it 85% of the time.

Like x 1 Jun 5, 2014 #7 Judge Well-Known Member Messages: 9,204 Karma: +8,115 I can maintain eye contact with people for a while, but always feel VERY self-conscious when I'm doing it. I consider it just another NT behavior I \"fake\" to get by. But it's one of those things I feel is also quite necessary if one has the ability to fake it. Otherwise you run the risk of appearing evasive or dishonest in the eyes of an NT world.   Agree x 1 Jun 5, 2014 #8 Vexx3 Member Messages: 39 Karma: +13 I think my inability to maintain eye contact is strongly connected to my intense fear of being judged.

Like x 1 Jun 5, 2014 #10 Vaegrant New Member Messages: 14 Karma: +10 Just want to share this real quick: I'm averse to eye contact but I still notice people's eyes and eye color. I commented on a guy's blacked out contacts once and he said that even people close to him haven't noticed them and he's been wearing them for weeks. I just wanted to reassure you guys, even NTs don't make eye contact. No one is judging you. No one cares. Just keep doing what makes you comfortable. You are all awesome just the way you are.

Facebook Twitter Tumblr Reddit Email Jan 22, 2010 #1 FireandShadows Well-Known Member Messages: 17 Karma: +0 Umm, I'm currently somewhere in the beginning of being officially diagnosed with Aspergers (I'm 16) and quite frankly I'm terrified about what's going to happen because I don't know. *wonders if that sentence made any sense* Basically, I was wondering if anyone would like to be awesome and give me some ideas on what to expect.   Jan 22, 2010 #2 Chris Guest Karma: +0 I can't comment too much since I've never been through the process, but from what I've heard, being diagnosed as a teenager is more or less the worst time - sometimes they will try and feed you the whole 'oh its just hormones' crap, I guess it must be worse for girls. Don't mean to put you off though. I'll let someone else give you a more detailed account. *Willow's cue...*   Jan 22, 2010 #3 AdzPearson Well-Known Member Messages: 46 Karma: +5 While I was being diagnosed, I was given a variety of both mental and physical tests. For mental, think along the lines of \"Here are some blocks. Recreate the pattern in this picture\". You may also be asked things like \"Put these into a category: Aluminium, Titanium and Steel\". As for physical, it was stuff like \"Stamp your feet and hit the drum at the same time\" (which I couldn't do, by the way XD). I didn't find it daunting really. Just take it as it comes and they should be able to accurately diagnose you in the end. If I remember correctly, it took a few months to complete. So yeah, nothing to worry about.   Jan 22, 2010 #4 regnkappa Well-Known Member Messages: 68 Karma: +2 Its more or less alot of test that shows what you really good at and what you are really bad at. you will still be you. But with abit more knowledge of how you function and abit why . Thats how I see it.   Jan 22, 2010 #5 Willow Guest Karma: +0 Erm. Yeah I got thrown the whole 'it's just your hormones' stuff. To be honest, my diagnosis is still incomplete, at the moment it's 'Autistic Spectrum Disorder' but I've seen SO many people now it's just stupid. A few reports that I have mention Asperger's, so I'm going with that. They really messed up with my diagnosis because to begin with I was there because my school noticed I was depressed. And so I had to have counselling and therapy and it was a long time before they mentioned any kind of Autism. Before that it was just mental illness'. So, if you go through what AdzPearson and Aspiedude went through, that sounds so much more awesome. The key is to just be yourself and answer things honestly. Don't try and act okay, or answer how you think they'll want you to answer. I have this thing where I try to be normal around strangers, which is NOT good when you're being assessed. Don't try and figure out where they're going with a line of questioning either, just answer with the thing that comes into your head first. Other than that, it'll be fine.   Jan 23, 2010 #6 Emor Well-Known Member Messages: 1,463 Karma: +31 I didn't even know I was getting diagnosed with anything at the time. I got diagnosed with Semantic Pragmatic Language Impairment and had to go to speech therapy. Then I assume the speech therapist referred me to a Psychologist to get dx'd with AS. This is around 5 years after the initial diagnosis because I got a new on like every 6 months. So then I saw the Psychologist guy and I just felt like he was interrogating me(and still do, LOL) so all that was clear really was that I had social anxiety, but my Mum brought in quite a lot of stuff I'd done at home in terms of projects and stuff and after around 2 years(only saw him every 6 months) I got dx'd with AS. So I basically agree with Willow. Be yourself or you're going to have a hard time getting anywhere . EMZ=]   Jan 23, 2010 #7 FireandShadows Well-Known Member Messages: 17 Karma: +0 Heey, thanks for all the advice guys! If anyone tries the hormones stuff I might just go crazy XD I hate it when people try to blame everything on hormones >< I just know I'm going to get horribly nervous when I actually go and see someone, which does make it a bit difficult to act like myself. But I'll just have to get over the nerves. So far, all that's happened is a lot of questionnaires for everyone except me. I want one! Lol. And after that I know there's going to be a 3 hour interview between them and my parents. So after that it's kind of like...hmm, I remember someone saying some of the stuff is like an IQ test? And physical stuff? Please tell me that's not truue!   Jan 23, 2010 #8 Chris Guest Karma: +0 Don't worry about it. If anything you being nervous about it might help as it will highlight your inconfidences when being assessed.... I think.   Jan 23, 2010 #9 Calvert 'Bout Ye? Messages: 1,190 Karma: +15 I didn't expect anything. I never knew I was being tested for a diagnoses. It was a stealth diagnoses :lol: Don't worry about. Remember, if you get diagnosed with AS you are still the same person you always were... only now with a label.   Jan 24, 2010 #10 FireandShadows Well-Known Member Messages: 17 Karma: +0 Lol, stealth diagnosis. I think I'll find it a relief to be diagnosed actually. I'm not very bothered about the fact that I have AS. When I first figured it out, which was after reading a book after finding out my brother has AS, I was quite happy that I'd found a reason for all the random crazy stuff that I do XD   (You must log in or sign up to reply here.)
